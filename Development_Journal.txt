Development Journal - Azure IaC ARM PoC
---------------------------------------

Purpose:
--------
To create a Proof of Concept (PoC) for deploying Azure infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
with ARM templates and source control (GitHub). The solution demonstrates use of the "Deploy to Azure" button
for rapid, standardized deployment into the active Azure tenant.

Development Timeline:
---------------------
- 2025-05-22: Initialized GitHub repo and created ARM template for Storage Account.
- 2025-05-22: Validated template using VS Code with ARM Tools extension.
- 2025-05-22: Added README with Deploy to Azure button.
- 2025-05-22: Created Development_Journal.txt to track references and decisions.

Security and Compliance Enhancements:
-------------------------------------
- HTTPS-only enforced via 'supportsHttpsTrafficOnly'.
- Public access to blob storage explicitly disabled.
- Restricted deployments to approved Azure regions.
- Tags included for environment, owner, application, and cost center tracking.
- Default tag values can be overridden by user input.

Lessons Learned:
----------------
- ARM templates are schema-strict; all parameters must match exactly.
- The Deploy to Azure button must link to a raw, URL-encoded GitHub URL.
- GitHub repo must be public for Azure to access the template.

Next Steps:
-----------
- Add more reusable modules (e.g., VNet, App Service).
- Set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions.
- Implement parameter files per environment (dev, test, prod).
